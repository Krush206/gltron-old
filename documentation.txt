Documentation

The documentation is brief. If someone wants to contribute some
documentation, I'd be very happy. The following is available:

   o Installation [#installation]
   o Usage (how to play) [#usage]
   o Interesting / relevant links [#links]

Installation

First, a 3D card is strongly recommended. Then, you need the right drivers
for your card. MacOS users contact their vendor (see links on the download
page), Win32 users run glsetup [http://www.glsetup.com] , if they haven't
already done so.

If you don't have a 3D card, don't dispair! I'll try to make a gltron version
available which is optimized for software rendering. Check back by end of
April. As for now, try to turn everything off in the Video / Texture Details
menu.

Installation on Win32 and MacOS is very simple. Extract the archive and start
the executable! Attention: 3dfx users might have problems with the
gltron.exe, which uses SDL. Use gltron_glut.exe instead, if you have
problems.

The following comments are only for people who want to compile the source
themselves (i.e. all Linux/Unix users).

Linux: Extract the sources somewhere and read the INSTALL file.

Other platforms: There will be a CodeWarrior and a Visual C++ Project
available when I'm back from my vacations.

Usage

Almost all settings can be changed through the menu system. Usage is
straightforward:

   o Use the cursor keys (Up/Down) and Space/Enter to navigate the menus.
   o Press Escape to ascend one menu level / get back to the game.
   o Use the Left/Right keys to change the volume settings in the Audio menu.

In the game:

'q' exits the game immediately (a panic button, just in case...)
Press Space to start / restart / pause the game

Change View

'F1': Single player view
'F2': Two player view
'F3': Four player view

'F10': Change Camera Mode - there are three different camera modes

Controls (default settings):

Player Turn left Turn right
1 'a' 's'
2 'k' 'l'
3 '5' '6'
4 'Left' 'Right'

'F12': Takes a screenshot (currently disabled on MacOS)

The linux and win32 versions support command line switches. A description is
available by typing 'gltron -h'.

Have Fun!

Sites of interest

These sites ran regular announcements of the linux version of glTron from
version 0.2 on

   o happypenguin.org [http://www.happypenguin.org/] , a site dedicated to
     linux gaming.
   o freshmeat [http://www.freshmeat.net/] , all the new software

Websites from people how contributed to glTron:

   o Peter Hajba [mailto:skaven@remedy.fi] composed the soundtrack for
     glTron. It's called Revenge of Cats and can be found (among other songs)
     at Skaven's Homepage [http://isis.yok.utu.fi/~skaven/music.html] ,

Other tron/lightcycle games (3d):

   o Tron 3D. [http://homepages.udayton.edu/~haagchra/games/tron.html] A very
     promising tron clone. Has a lightcycle model, sound effects ripped from
     the movie, etc. It tries to stay very close to the movie scene.
     Unfortunately it runs only under windows.
   o Armagetron [http://pluto.spaceports.com/~zman/armagetron/tron.html] .
     GPL'd, 3D. I haven't played this one yet.
   o Newtron. [http://home.t-online.de/home/ahippauf/newtron.htm] Looks like
     some Amiga fans (yes, that thing still exists) are doing exactly the
     same as I.

If you are into linux games, try this:

   o Tuxedo T. Penguin: A Quest for Herring
     [http://www.woodsoup.org/projs/tux_aqfh/] , an impressive 3D game with
     very cute graphics and huge potential. If you have any talent in level
     design, music or art, go and help them.

Other stuff

   o If you are interested in OpenGL and want to support gltron, buy a book
     [amazon.html] (the page contains links to amazon.com / amazon.de that
     will get me a 15% provision).
